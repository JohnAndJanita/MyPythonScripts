My notes for Stocks.py:

Command line syntax: Stocks [ticker(s)]

Ideas for improvements:
*	Find a way to create an Excel fuelgage style cell to show the current stock price
	as it compares with the 52 week highs and lows.
* 	Create one or more graphs from historical data that is captured.
*	Automate alerts that are listed for each ticker within the sheet for that ticker.
	The idea is to simplify drawing attention to the positive and negative data
	for any given ticker.
*	Use a dictionary for the data collected, making it easier to modify content without
	a lot of programming changes.

Alerts:
*	Price trending alerts as compared with 50 and 200 day average
*	Price trending alerts as compared with 52 week highs and lows
*	10 day volume is much more than average, a signal of a recent spike in interest
*	Negative PE
*	Very high PE
*	PE trending: up? down?
* 	Negative EPS
* 	EPS trending: up? down?
*	Poor EPS predictions
*	Excessive Price/Book value
*	Excessive Short interest
*	Negative growth
*	Peculiar values such as institutions holding more than 100% of a stock? MRSN
*	No cash flow issues
*	Lack of financials
